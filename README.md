Brunel's Peckish
------- OBJECTIVE:

MVP:

To create a user-friendly Reactive (made with React) Restaurant App that renders to screen the meals available from the resturants server (Firebase Real Database mockup). Customers are then able to place an order with all information being sent back to a server, where resturant can then plan prepare and deliver food.

------- TASKS:

DESIGN: Create a SPA using React emulating a real restaurant. Decide on colours and components to be used. Decide on how app will look at different screen sizes

BUILD PROJECT: Study and finalise the API's needed in the project:

------- STRUGGLES:

Creating the logic of adding the amount of an item once it has been added to the account while maintaining a pure reducer function/ not mutating the original state.

------- FUTURE PLANS:

Rebuild this project using React REDUX toolkit, Routing and with NodeJS backend. Implement React Lazy loading to reduce load times.
